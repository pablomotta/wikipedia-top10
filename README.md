### What the project does

This a search app that makes an ajax call to the wikipedia search api and retrieves the top 10 results with a title, short description snippet and a button with a link to the page.

### Challenges

My challenges in while building this app were mainly in engineering the .getJSON call to the wikipedia api and retrieving the right pieces of information from the returned object. I overcame these challenges with the help of reading documentations and by pair programing with my friend Tim who is also a mentor. Tim helped me dial down the code to the cleanest, elegant and organized version.

I also faced a big challenge while styling the page. Up to this point I hadn't coded much css with retina display devices in mind so getting this app to look good in all devices ( phones, tablets and desktops) was a learning experience.
